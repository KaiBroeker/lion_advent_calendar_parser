# lion club advent calendar parser
The lions club in my city makes an advent calendar every year.  
They publish the new winners on their website every day. To avoid having to look up the winners manually every day I wrote this little parser.

## How to use:
To avoid having to enter the numbers every day, they are stored in a variable in the code. Here you just have to enter your numbers.
```
String[] tmp_Numbers = { "1234", "0121", ... };
```


As a second option you can can deside if you want to output all machted or only for today:
```
bool alldays = false|true;
```

# Have fun!
